    <center><h1>The role of artificial Intellegance in changing human life</center></h1>
    <h3> <p><h3> Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities.<br>
	Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity,<br>
	offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats. As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI<br>
	continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?<br><br>
	Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered><br>
	this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.<br><br>
    The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy,<br>
	agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence<br>
	and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition,<br>
	visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, <br>
	on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.<br><br>
    Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients<br>
	or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad <br>
	public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes<br>
	to nutrition. Additionally, a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated <br>
	changes in formal and informal education systems.<br><br>
    Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term <br>
	impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked<br>
	to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared deep worries, and many also suggested pathways<br>
	toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.<br><br>
	<h2>Specifically, participants were asked to consider the following:</h2><br></h3> </p></h3>
    <h3> <p><h3>“Please think forward to the year 2030. Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence <br>
	(AI) in complex digital systems. Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results<br>
	as we widely implement these networked tools. Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related <br>
	is likely to lead to widespread difficulties.<br><br>
    Our question: By 2030, do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities <br>
	and empower them? That is, most of the time, will most people be better off than they are today? Or is it most likely<br>
	that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people<br>
	will not be better off than the way things are today?”<br><br>
	Overall, and despite the downsides they fear, 63% of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful<br>
	that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030, and 37% said people will not be better off.<br><br>
	A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans’ expanding reliance on technological systems will <br>
	only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools, platforms and networks are engineered, distributed and updated.<br>
	Some of the powerful, overarching answers included those from:<br><br>
	<h2>Sonia Katyal,</h2><br></h3> </p></h3>
	<h3> <p><h3>“co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology and a member of the inaugural U.S.<br> 
	Commerce Department Digital Economy Board of Advisors, predicted, “In 2030, the greatest set of questions will involve how perceptions of AI<br>
	and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future. Questions about privacy, speech,<br>
	the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re-emerge in this new AI context,<br>
	throwing into question our deepest-held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all.<br>
	Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today,<br>
	for the future.”</h3> </p></h3><br><br><br>
