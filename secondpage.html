	<center><h1>History of Artificial Intellegance</center></h1>
     <h3> <p><h3>The idea of inanimate objects coming to life as intelligent beings has been around for a long time. <br>
          The ancient Greeks had myths about robots, and Chinese and Egyptian engineers built automatons.<br><br>
          The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. <br>
         But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956,
		 at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined..<br><br>
       MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky and others who attended the conference were extremely optimistic about AI's future. "Within a generation [...]<br>
	   the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved,"<br>
	   Minsky is quoted as saying in the book "AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence" (Basic Books, 1994).<br>
	   [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures] <br><br>
	    But achieving an artificially intelligent being wasn't so simple. After several reports criticizing progress in AI,<br>
		government funding and interest in the field dropped off – a period from 1974–80 that became known as the "AI winter."<br>
		The field later revived in the 1980s when the British government started funding it again in part to compete with efforts by the Japanese.<br><br>
	   The field experienced another major winter from 1987 to 1993, coinciding with the collapse <br>
	   of the market for some of the early general-purpose computers
	   , and reduced government funding.<br><br>
	   But research began to pick up again after that, and in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a chess champio<br>
	   when it defeated Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov. And in 2011, the computer giant's question-answering system Watson won<br>
	   the quiz show "Jeopardy!" by beating reigning champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.<br><br>
	   This year, the talking computer "chatbot" Eugene Goostman captured headlines for tricking judges into thinking he was<br>
	   real skin-and-blood human during a Turing test, a competition developed by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing<br>
	   in 1950 as a way to assess whether a machine is intelligent.<br><br>
	  But the accomplishment has been controversial, with artificial intelligence experts saying that only a third of the judges were fooled,<br>
	  and pointing out that the bot was able to dodge some questions by claiming it was an adolescent who spoke English as a second language. <br><br>
	  
	   Manyexperts now believe the Turing test isn't a good measure of artificial intelligence.<br><br>
"The vast majority of people in AI who've thought about the matter, for the most part, think it’s a very poor test,<br>
 because it only looks at external behavior," Perlis told Live Science.<br><br>
	In fact, some scientists now plan to develop an updated version of the test.<br>
	But the field of AI has become much broader than just the pursuit of true, humanlike intelligence. <br>  <br>
